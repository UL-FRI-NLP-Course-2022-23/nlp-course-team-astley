0 [SEP] Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived a sly and cunning fox named Fawkes. Fawkes was known for his quick wit and sharp mind, and he loved nothing more than outsmarting the other animals in the forest. However, there was one animal in particular that Fawkes had a fierce rivalry with - a loyal and brave dog named Duke.

Duke was known for his strength and loyalty, and he had been tasked by the other animals in the forest to keep Fawkes in check. Despite Fawkes' clever schemes, Duke had always managed to foil his plans, and the two animals had become archenemies.

One sunny day, as Fawkes was wandering through the forest, he stumbled upon a beautiful meadow. The meadow was surrounded by tall trees and lush green grass, and Fawkes couldn't resist exploring it. However, as he was wandering through the meadow, he suddenly heard a loud bark. It was Duke, who had been patrolling the forest and had caught sight of Fawkes in the meadow.

Fawkes knew that he was no match for Duke in a fight, so he quickly devised a plan to outsmart him. He spotted a fallen tree trunk in the middle of the meadow, and he knew that if he could jump over it, he could prove to Duke that he was just as strong and agile as he was. Fawkes smirked to himself, thinking that he had finally found a way to one-up Duke.

Duke, who was watching Fawkes from the edge of the meadow, knew that the fox was up to something. He had learned to never let his guard down around Fawkes, and he was determined to find out what he was planning. As Fawkes approached the tree trunk, Duke crept closer, ready to pounce if Fawkes made any sudden movements. But when they reached their destination...the beast lurched forward toward them! With an audible thud on its muzzle--a powerful roar filled both houses at once --and then another squeal followed shortly thereafter....The creature roared back into existence again; this Time's Fury would be remembered forever because only those closest were able [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD]  man men Men Man King Men Men Men Kingsmen Men Masters Master Masters Male [PAD] [PAD] [PAD]  man male man man king man man master monger man man man man man man man man mansman prince MAN MEN MAN MAN
